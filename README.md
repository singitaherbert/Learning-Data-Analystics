#Origin of data analysis 
The origins of data analysis trace back to ancient Egypt, where data organization was pivotal in building pyramids. The Egyptians documented calculations and theories on papyri, which are viewed as early spreadsheets and checklists. Modern data analysis builds on these foundations.

The data analysis process varies but shares common elements. The Google Data Analytics Certificate outlines six steps:

1. **Ask**: Define the business problem or objective.
2. **Prepare**: Collect and manage data.
3. **Process**: Clean and validate data.
4. **Analyze**: Explore, visualize, and interpret data.
5. **Share**: Communicate results.
6. **Act**: Apply insights to solve problems.

Different models exist, including those by EMC, SAS, Vignesh Prajapati, and authors of big data analytics, each emphasizing phases like discovery, data preparation, analysis, and acting on insights. These models highlight the cyclical and iterative nature of data analysis, showing various approaches but maintaining core principles. The evolution of data analysis shows consistent themes, despite different structures, ensuring effectiveness across methods.
